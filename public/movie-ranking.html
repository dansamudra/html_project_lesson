<h1> The Best Movie According to Samudra</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>
    Fight Club is just a very well-made, brilliantly written and superlatively performed film. Essentially a satirical fable, it tells of an insomniac loser teaming up with a seditious soap salesman to form a no-holds-barred-fight club as an outlet for their direction-less aggression. This concept is an intriguing and original one, and works really well. Then there is the script, it is absolutely superb, with dialogue that will make you both laugh and think. Fight Club is very well made, with elaborate production design, great editing and startling images. David Fincher's direction is brilliantly handled and the performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are superb

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
    The Dark Knight is so groundbreaking because it is one of the first superhero movies in the public eye that is not an action movie, but rather is a drama. 
    You’re watching it to see the realism in how Gotham reflects in many ways the current state of many modern American cities. 
    You’re watching it to watch the breathtaking acting performances of Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, and many others. 
    You’re watching it because the scenes are really well crafted and well written. 
    The climax of the movie is not an effects-ridden battle scene, it’s the culmination of several tough choices, resolved mostly through dialogue and a few gunshots. 
    And at the end? The hero doesn’t win. It’s a much more dramatic and realistic take on the superhero movie.

<h3>Catch Me If You Can</h3>
<p>
    This movie is extremely good. The music, the nostalgic 60s, the character Frank William Abagnale JR portrayed perfectly by Leonardo DiCaprio. Hanks is extraordinary, and put together with Christopher Walkens serious acting, this movie is one of Spielbergs best movies ever.
